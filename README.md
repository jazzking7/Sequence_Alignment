# Sequence alignment using Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm
Can be used to find the optimal alignment between two sequences (DNA, Amino acids, etc) \
using the given scoring scheme. \
See sample1.fasta to know the format of the input file. \
Usage: 
1. Select the file that you want to analyze. 
2. Enter parameters (score for match, mismatch, gap penalty). 
3. Click the compute button to obtain the results. 

Notice that if the given sequences are too long, the full solution can't be displayed. \
See the result textfile for full solution.
